# New idea 🤔

### Physics Analogy

In physics, the double-slit experiment shows a striking fact: the act of observation changes the outcome. Once we measure a photon, its wave function collapses from a superposition to a definite state, destroying the interference pattern. (Copenhagen interpretation) From my limited understanding, observation forces the photon to abandon randomness across the distribution of possible points, and instead it “chooses” to appear at one slit with certainty.

### Financial Markets

Financial markets show a similar effect.
When a trader tries to “observe” the market (e.g., probing liquidity, submitting/canceling orders), these actions leave footprints that other participants detect. Such active actions break the randomness in the market (making it less efficient? 🤔). As a result, the price distribution and beliefs of others shift. 
In other words: observation alters the observed system.


### Idea

Map “wave function collapse” → market belief updates (posterior π replacing prior π⁻).🤔

Define a collapse rate = the sensitivity of the market to our actions (or equivalently, the rate of information leakage)

Set a goal to minimize this collapse rate: min(CollapseRate(action))

This yields “as invisible as possible observation” 🤔 extracting information or executing trades without disrupting market efficiency

👉 Minimize the wave function collapse rate → make our strategy as invisible as possible.



Update slowly, purely write down sth interesting in my mind👀...
